# Pact Network

Pact Network is a parametric micro-insurance system for AI agent API payments on Solana. It monitors API provider reliability in real-time, computes actuarially-derived insurance rates from observed failure data, and publishes those rates on a public scorecard. The insurance rate is the product — everything else exists to make that number real, accurate, and public.

## Tech Stack

- **Language:** TypeScript (all packages)
- **Backend:** Fastify (API server), PostgreSQL (database)
- **Scorecard:** Vite + React + Tailwind CSS + Recharts (SPA dashboard)
- **SDK:** Wraps fetch(), JSON file local storage, x402/MPP header extraction
- **Deployment:** Docker Compose + Caddy (same-origin on pactnetwork.io)

## Monorepo Structure

```

  sdk/        — @pact-network/monitor: TypeScript SDK wrapping fetch() to monitor API reliability
  backend/    — @pact-network/backend: Fastify API server aggregating monitoring data
  scorecard/  — @pact-network/scorecard: Vite+React dashboard showing provider reliability rankings

## Design System

- **Background:** #151311 (dark)
- **Copper:** #B87333 (financial values, insurance rates)
- **Burnt Sienna:** #C9553D (failures, violations, HIGH RISK)
- **Slate:** #5A6B7A (healthy, RELIABLE states)
- **Fonts:** Inria Serif (headlines), Inria Sans (body), JetBrains Mono (data)
- **Aesthetic:** Brutalist — zero/minimal border radius, no gradients, no emojis in code or UI

## Build & Run

```bash
# Install all workspace dependencies
npm install

# SDK
cd packages/sdk && npm run build

# Backend (needs PostgreSQL running)
cd packages/backend && npm run dev

# Scorecard
cd packages/scorecard && npm run dev

# Seed data
cd packages/backend && npm run seed

# Generate API key
cd packages/backend && npm run generate-key <label>
```

## API Endpoints

- `POST /api/v1/records` — batch ingest call records (authenticated)
- `GET /api/v1/providers` — list all providers ranked by insurance rate (public)
- `GET /api/v1/providers/:id` — provider detail with percentiles and breakdown (public)
- `GET /api/v1/providers/:id/timeseries` — failure rate over time (public)
- `GET /health` — server health check
- `GET /api/v1/analytics/summary` — network-wide aggregate stats (public)
- `GET /api/v1/analytics/timeseries` — requests and claims over time (public)
- `GET /api/v1/claims` — list individual claim records with filters (public)

## Conventions

- No emojis in code or UI

# GitNexus — Code Intelligence

This project is indexed by GitNexus as **pact-network** (877 symbols, 1704 relationships, 40 execution flows). Use the GitNexus MCP tools to understand code, assess impact, and navigate safely.

> If any GitNexus tool warns the index is stale, run `npx gitnexus analyze` in terminal first.

## Always Do

- **MUST run impact analysis before editing any symbol.** Before modifying a function, class, or method, run `gitnexus_impact({target: "symbolName", direction: "upstream"})` and report the blast radius (direct callers, affected processes, risk level) to the user.
- **MUST run `gitnexus_detect_changes()` before committing** to verify your changes only affect expected symbols and execution flows.
- **MUST warn the user** if impact analysis returns HIGH or CRITICAL risk before proceeding with edits.
- When exploring unfamiliar code, use `gitnexus_query({query: "concept"})` to find execution flows instead of grepping. It returns process-grouped results ranked by relevance.
- When you need full context on a specific symbol — callers, callees, which execution flows it participates in — use `gitnexus_context({name: "symbolName"})`.

## When Debugging

1. `gitnexus_query({query: "<error or symptom>"})` — find execution flows related to the issue
2. `gitnexus_context({name: "<suspect function>"})` — see all callers, callees, and process participation
3. `READ gitnexus://repo/pact-network/process/{processName}` — trace the full execution flow step by step
4. For regressions: `gitnexus_detect_changes({scope: "compare", base_ref: "main"})` — see what your branch changed

## When Refactoring

- **Renaming**: MUST use `gitnexus_rename({symbol_name: "old", new_name: "new", dry_run: true})` first. Review the preview — graph edits are safe, text_search edits need manual review. Then run with `dry_run: false`.
- **Extracting/Splitting**: MUST run `gitnexus_context({name: "target"})` to see all incoming/outgoing refs, then `gitnexus_impact({target: "target", direction: "upstream"})` to find all external callers before moving code.
- After any refactor: run `gitnexus_detect_changes({scope: "all"})` to verify only expected files changed.

## Never Do

- NEVER edit a function, class, or method without first running `gitnexus_impact` on it.
- NEVER ignore HIGH or CRITICAL risk warnings from impact analysis.
- NEVER rename symbols with find-and-replace — use `gitnexus_rename` which understands the call graph.
- NEVER commit changes without running `gitnexus_detect_changes()` to check affected scope.

## Tools Quick Reference

| Tool | When to use | Command |
|------|-------------|---------|
| `query` | Find code by concept | `gitnexus_query({query: "auth validation"})` |
| `context` | 360-degree view of one symbol | `gitnexus_context({name: "validateUser"})` |
| `impact` | Blast radius before editing | `gitnexus_impact({target: "X", direction: "upstream"})` |
| `detect_changes` | Pre-commit scope check | `gitnexus_detect_changes({scope: "staged"})` |
| `rename` | Safe multi-file rename | `gitnexus_rename({symbol_name: "old", new_name: "new", dry_run: true})` |
| `cypher` | Custom graph queries | `gitnexus_cypher({query: "MATCH ..."})` |

## Impact Risk Levels

| Depth | Meaning | Action |
|-------|---------|--------|
| d=1 | WILL BREAK — direct callers/importers | MUST update these |
| d=2 | LIKELY AFFECTED — indirect deps | Should test |
| d=3 | MAY NEED TESTING — transitive | Test if critical path |

## Resources

| Resource | Use for |
|----------|---------|
| `gitnexus://repo/pact-network/context` | Codebase overview, check index freshness |
| `gitnexus://repo/pact-network/clusters` | All functional areas |
| `gitnexus://repo/pact-network/processes` | All execution flows |
| `gitnexus://repo/pact-network/process/{name}` | Step-by-step execution trace |

## Self-Check Before Finishing

Before completing any code modification task, verify:
1. `gitnexus_impact` was run for all modified symbols
2. No HIGH/CRITICAL risk warnings were ignored
3. `gitnexus_detect_changes()` confirms changes match expected scope
4. All d=1 (WILL BREAK) dependents were updated

## Keeping the Index Fresh

After committing code changes, the GitNexus index becomes stale. Re-run analyze to update it:

```bash
npx gitnexus analyze
```

If the index previously included embeddings, preserve them by adding `--embeddings`:

```bash
npx gitnexus analyze --embeddings
```

To check whether embeddings exist, inspect `.gitnexus/meta.json` — the `stats.embeddings` field shows the count (0 means no embeddings). **Running analyze without `--embeddings` will delete any previously generated embeddings.**

## GitNexus — Worktree gotcha (read me before running analyze)

> This section lives **outside** the `gitnexus:start`…`gitnexus:end` markers on
> purpose. Anything inside those markers gets regenerated from a hardcoded
> template every time `gitnexus analyze` runs — our own notes would be wiped.

`gitnexus analyze` derives the project name from `path.basename(repoPath)` and
regenerates both `CLAUDE.md` and `AGENTS.md` between the marker blocks. If you
run it from a git worktree (e.g. `../pact-network-feature-x`), every
`pact-network` reference inside the block is rewritten to the worktree
directory's basename, silently corrupting the agent instructions for the next
committer.

**Rules for this repo:**
- Only run `gitnexus analyze` from the primary checkout at `.../pact-network`,
  where `path.basename` already equals `pact-network`.
- If you're working in a worktree, **skip the refresh** — the user-level
  PostToolUse hook will still kick off `gitnexus analyze` after any commit in
  that worktree, so assume `CLAUDE.md` / `AGENTS.md` will be dirty and
  `git checkout --` them before pushing.
- Never commit a `CLAUDE.md` / `AGENTS.md` diff whose only change is the
  project-name token swapping to a worktree directory name — revert it.
